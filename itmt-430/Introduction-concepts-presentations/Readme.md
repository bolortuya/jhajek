* ~2:58 - What is the first principle of Ethics in Software Engineering ~1997
  * Product: software is well documented and satisfied user's approval.
* ~5:20 - What is rule 6.10 of Ethics in Software Engineering ~1997
  * Obey all laws governing their work, insofar as such obedience is consistent with the public health, safety, and health.
* ~6:45 - With the rise of what in the late 1990s did the first real foreshocks of ethical dilemmas come?

Many of the winners are Sillican Valey style enterprenurial technology companies that are invading established indsutry structures. Many more industies is going to be destroyed by software with the new world beating Silican Valley companies.

## Presentation Two

[Jessica Kerr - Principles of Collaborative Automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY4HPhXuWFg&feature=emb_logo "Jessica Kerr - Principles of Collaborative Automation")

* ~1:04 Where did Ms. Kerr's 4 Principles come out of?
  * Resilience engineering community and studies of collaberation between humans and machines.
* ~3:15 What is the difference between developers and everyone else mentioned?
  * Developers can change the software if it is hard to operate. 
* ~4:15 What is "symmathesy?"
  * Learning system made of learning parts. We learn from each other and we learn from the software. THe software also learn from us. We need all the tools. It is based on mutual learning.
* ~5:57 List and briefly describe the 1st principle of Joint Activity?
  * Basic Impace: we are working towards a common goal and our tasks are interrelated. 
* ~7:26 What is collaboration?
  * It is about getting help before something crashes. Give details and help the software.
* ~8:44 What is the difference between, "rely on" vs. "work with"?
  * you don't rely on your team workers 24/7. We work with each other your team members and the software. 
* ~9:00 What is [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/ "Apache Kafka") and what does it do?
  * It is open source and streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. 
* ~10:25 List and briefly describe the 2nd principle of Joint Activity?
  * Mutually Predictable: people must be understand their state and action and know what is about to happen. They must direct and explain their plans.
* ~15:10 List and briefly describe the 3rd principle of Joint Activity?
  * Mutual Directabiliy: once you can predict each other, you can change what each other going to do by discussing the plan. The plan can be changed if there is a better plan. Therefore, human is in charge.
* ~17:45 What is the strange property of negotiations?
  * Party with less flexibility have more power. People are flexible because there are many ways we can do it, but computers are not flexible. 
* ~19:25 List and briefly describe the 4th principle of Joint Activity
  * Common Ground: Everyone knows the basic standard of the code or the work. Be careful with what you are doing.   
* ~22:36 Increased complexity can be balanced by what?
  * can be balanced by increased software. 
* ~22:48 Success begets what and why?
  * complexity begats success because it adds reliability and get codes out of people's head. 
* ~24:40 Briefly describe the 4 ironies of automation.
  * 1. Smarter the automation, harder it is to operate. It takes more feedback, more experience and more cretive problem solving.
2. Exceptions are the rules. Start from the exceptional rule. Worst case start with a human and gradually increase the autonamation. 
3. Automating the easy stuff makes the harder stuff harder. Specialization can help to deal with the hard stuff regularily.
4. The less flexible party has more power to get its way. Keep the human informed and in charge.
